# Rust blue pill learning demo

My personal walk through learning Rust development on STM32 family of microcontrollers, using:

 - Blue Pill development board with STM32F030C8 microcontroller as target device
 - STLink v2 as a programming and debugging interface
 - Debian 11 bullseye and Visual studio code as development environment

## Userful Resources

Following links contain a lot of useful resources about STM32 platform and Rust
